# Persistent Volume

## Setup Pod resources & limits

### Creating a CPU Limit:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-deploy
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: localhost:5000/test
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
```
Deployment:
```
kubectl apply -f .\pod-concepts\3-volume\deployment-limite-cpu.yaml.yaml
```

Check CPU :
```
kubectl describe deployment test-deploy
```

### Creating a Memory Limit

The container will be limited to 512Mi of RAM. Kubernetes will still allow it to access more if the node itâ€™s scheduled on has excess capacity. Otherwise, exceeding the limit will result in the container being marked as a candidate for termination.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-deploy
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: localhost:5000/test
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "512Mi"
```
### Storage Limits

All Kubernetes nodes have an amount of ephemeral storage available. 
This container would now be limited to using 1Gi of the available ephemeral storage. Pods that try to use more storage will be evicted. When there are multiple containers in a pod, the pod is evicted if the sum of the storage usage from all of the containers exceeds the overall storage limit.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-deploy
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: localhost:5000/test
      resources:
        limits:
          ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
```

## Setup Pod with startup, liveness, and readiness probes.

The kubelet uses liveness probes to know if an application running as in a healthy state and if unhealthy state then restart a container and tries to redeploy it . 
For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. 

```
kubectl apply -f ex-linesse.yaml
```

check before 30 secondes :
we will see that no liveness probes have failed yet.
```
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
  Normal  Scheduled  5s    default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/liveness-exec to docker-desktop
  Normal  Pulling    4s    kubelet            Pulling image "localhost:5000/busybox"

  Normal  Started    4s    kubelet            Started container liveness
```

and after 30 seconde :
```
 Type     Reason     Age                From               Message
  ----     ------     ----               ----               -------

  Warning  Unhealthy  44s (x3 over 54s)  kubelet            Liveness probe failed: cat: can't open '/tmp/healthy': No such file or directory

  Normal   Pulling    14s (x2 over 88s)  kubelet            Pulling image "localhost:5000/busybox"

  Normal   Started    14s (x2 over 88s)  kubelet            Started container liveness
```

The kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.
A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. One use of this signal is to control which Pods are used as backends for Services. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.

The kubelet uses startup probes to know when a container application has started.
If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup. This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, avoiding them getting killed by the kubelet before they are up and running.

## Add Persistent Volume to the pod.
